**Learning Outcomes**

After completing this experiment, the learner will be able to:

Understand and implement local state management in React applications using the useState hook for component-level data handling.

Differentiate between local and global state, and identify appropriate use cases for each based on data scope and reusability.

Implement global state management using Context API, enabling state sharing across multiple components without prop drilling.

Apply Redux for centralized state management, understanding actions, reducers, store, and how global state updates affect multiple components simultaneously.

Compare performance, scalability, and re-render behavior of useState, Context API, and Redux, and choose the appropriate state management approach for real-world React applications.
